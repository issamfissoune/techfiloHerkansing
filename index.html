                The Altair 8800 is one of the first personal microcomputer kits made by Henry Edwards Roberts and his
                team. The Altair 8800 kit was available in 1975 for less than $400 (M Johnson, Y. (2014). History
                Corner. History Corner, 58(1), 13). People from
                various house hold were able to purchase one, however that was not the case. The Altair 8800 managed to
                sell quite a lot after more than 4000 orders have been placed, this was not expected especially since
                the Altair 8800 didn’t have many functions to it, nonetheless it was a great success among the other
                microcumputer kits.
                <br>
                The Altair didn’t get its success just like that, what made the Altair 8800 so amazing is the fact that
                it used the Intel 8080 processor. The Intel 8080 ("eighty-eighty") is the second 8-bit microprocessor
                designed and manufactured by Intel (Intel 8080. (z.d.). Wikepedia. Geraadpleegd op 2 september 2021, van
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080). The Altair 8800 was one of the first
                microcomputers that used this processor.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Altair 8800 is what introduced the idea of owning a personal computer to the mass. Computers were
                only used by scientist and the military back in the day, but the Altair 8800 changed that forever. It
                was made to help people learn more about technology which also led to the advance of this technology,
                because the Altair 8800 sparked a lot of ideas but more on that later.

                <p>
                    The man behind it all is no one other than Henry Edward Roberts, also known as "the father of the
                    personal computer.". Edward Roberts was a master of all crafts, he wasn’t only known as an engineer
                    he was more than that, Edward Roberts was also an entrepreneur, medical doctor and most important he
                    founded Micro Instrumentations and Telemetry Systems. Before his fame for building the first
                    microcomputer, Roberts was known for creating one of the first working electric calculators, however
                    that succes didn’t last for long. Competition grew rapidly and Roberts was forced into debt due to
                    this competition. Roberts began developing something else. A couple years later Roberts released the
                    Altair 8800 that used the new Intel 8080 processor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The creation of the Altair 8800 caught the attention of young Paul Allen and Bill Gates who proposed
                    to Roberts to write software for the Altair 8800, which later lead to the creation of The Altair
                    BASIC which was Microsoft’s first creation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Roberts didn’t remain in the field of technology for very long after creating the Altair 8800,
                    because in 1977, 2 years after the creation of the Altair 8800, Roberts deciced to sell MITS and
                    retire to the state of Georgia where he spent most of his time farming, studying medicine and later
                    becoming the town’s doctor.

                    The Altair 8800 wasn’t necessarily the greatest invention, since it didn’t do much, didn’t even
                    include a keyboard or mouse and didn’t come with a monitor. However these flaws that came with the
                    Altair 8800 is what drove other engineers to create better and smarter microcomputers. This has
                    created a revolutionary era where microcomputers were more accessible to not just any computer geek
                    but also your average house hold. Different companies started making their own microcomputers, the
                    market for computers and personal systems was bigger than ever. The Altair helped create this new
                    market.

                <p>
                    Edward said the following in an interview. "One of the things that became evident right away
                    was that people lusted after those machines. I don't know any better way to describe it: They lusted
                    after it," Ed Roberts told W. David Gardner in Reflections: An Oral History of the Computer
                    Industry, a supplement to Computer Systems News.

                <h3>The Process</h3>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>
                    The process of building the Altair 8800 wasn’t an easy one this is because Roberts has never built a
                    computer before, and no one in his team had much experiene either, but what kept Roberts going was
                    the love he has for his craft. He managed to purchase the Intel 8080 for $75 each instead of paying
                    the retail price of $350, he did this by buying the processor in bulk. The next step for Roberts
                    took is the text book definition of “leap of faith”, not only did Roberts make a deal with Popular
                    Electronics, he also agreed to keeping the cost of the machine below $500. He did all this to be
                    able to gain enough coverage for the machine, it was one big gamble, because the future of the
                    company was relying on this gamble, since they’re already in so much debt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Roberts didn’t have a great idea yet but he did have a clear idea of what he wants to create.
                    Roberts said as followed, "The basic ground rules for a personal computer from a technical
                    standpoint is that it had to be a real, fully operational computer that was fully expandable and at
                    least in principal could do anything that a general purpose minicomputer of the time could do.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a goal in mind and a deadline to reach, MITS did not waste any time and got to building. It was
                    a very bumpy ride though since Roberts and his team were really small and did not have the man power
                    necessary to mass produce the Altair 8800. People who really helped with this was Roberts’ senior
                    engineer William Bill Yates and Bybe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Roberts also contributed to alot, as he was the one who designed the interface logic for the Intel
                    8080, a 2MHz clock, 256-byte RAM memory and the front panel logic for the 25 input and much more.
                    Something that Roberts did that was a great decision during the making of the Altair 8800 was the
                    fact that he left room for upgrade. If someone wanted to add additional space to their microcomputer
                    than this was more than welcome.

                    The altair 8800 gave people ideas to make better and more advanced computers, due to this impact
                    people like me can have a computer at home where I get to program the code used for my robot.
